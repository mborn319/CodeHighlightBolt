Code Highlight
=======================

Code Highlight highlights code syntax in any part of your Bolt site.

This extension uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
See the [documentation](https://highlightjs.org/usage/) for more details on usage or the [demo](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) for a list of supported languages.

This extension adds CSS and JS to all of your pages to provide highlighting. You can use this anywhere by adding `<pre><code>` tags to a piece of content:
```html
<pre>
    <code class="html">
        <p>this will be highlighted</p>
    </code>
</pre>
```
